I uploaded the main files of school projects of my 4th year at CPE-Lyon : 

1- Robot with me
  It is a commercial website for a fictionnal company which could sell robotic equipements.
  There is a main page which leads to the rest of the website, a list of items a client can purchase, thanks to a shooping cart, and it is also posible to contact the company through a contact form.
  
2- Web Command for a robot
  It is a web interface to command a robot to move or perform measures on a pre-established map with or without obstacles.
  For this project we did not have a working robot so we used a simulation with which we communicate with sockets.
  There are some administration functionalities : the command page can be locked by an administrator registered in the database
